# Among-Us-Hack-2020.9.22s-Radar
A among us hack for 2020.9.22s with radar support. Radar is very buggy and only supports 1 map, but it does its job, you can learn from the code at any time.
Also, my code is not optimized at all xd.
Also, the packages folder does not contain all the nuget packages.
If you couldnt find the nuget packages, make sure you have Memory.ddll and System.Security.Principal.Windows.dll.
I wont do any updates here, if theres a problem, i wont fix it most likely.
